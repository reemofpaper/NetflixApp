# NetflixApp
This is an application to access the Netflix database and allow the user to perform certain actions. It generates a simple, yet functional interface in C# for the user to interact with the database. I implemeneted functions for the user to add movies, add reviews, view average rating of a movie, and view prolific users.

Breakdown

	> The "Presentation Tier" includes a Form GUI
	> The "Business Tier" supports the security, business rules, and data processing needed by this particular application 
	> The "Data Access Tier" interface between business tier and data store â€” the data access tier does not manage nor store data, it only facilitates access to the data
	> The "Data Store" stores the actual data repository
